Clicking on one of the player picture should open another activity which shows the
full screen view of the selected player and enable to navigate forward from the
current picture selected

The assignment should consist of two activities:
1. Activity with a grid view to show the thumbnails of the 11 players
2. Activity to show the full screen view of the selected player which allows you
  to move forward from the current picture
